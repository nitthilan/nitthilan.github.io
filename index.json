The key idea behind LEANets is to design classifiers of increasing complexity using pretrained DNNs to perform input-specific adaptive inference. The accuracy and energy consumption of the adaptive inference scheme depends on a set of thresholds, one for each classifier.

We can select the appropriate threshold vector at runtime based on the desired tradeoff. We perform experiments on multiple pretrained DNNs including ConvNet, VGG-16, and MobileNet using diverse image classification datasets.

AD algorithms score the data instances and produce a ranked list of candidate anomalies, which are then analyzed by a human to discover the true anomalies. However, this process can be laborious for the human analyst when the number of false-positives is very high. Therefore, in many real-world AD applications including computer security and fraud prevention, the anomaly detector must be configurable by the human analyst to minimize the effort on false positives. In this paper, we study the problem of active learning to automatically tune ensemble of anomaly detectors to maximize the number of true anomalies discovered. We make four main contributions towards this goal. First, we present an important insight that explains the practical successes of AD ensembles and how ensembles are naturally suited for active learning. Second, we present several algorithms for active learning with tree-based AD ensembles. These algorithms help us to improve the diversity of discovered anomalies, generate rule sets for improved interpretability of anomalous instances, and adapt to streaming data settings in a principled manner. Third, we present a novel algorithm called GLocalized Anomaly Detection (GLAD) for active learning with generic AD ensembles. GLAD allows end-users to retain the use of simple and understandable global anomaly detectors by automatically learning their local relevance to specific data instances using label feedback.

Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the integration of a large number of processing elements (PEs) in a single die. To design optimized manycore systems, we need to establish suitable trade-offs among multiple objectives including power, performance, and thermal. Therefore, we consider multi-objective design space exploration (MO-DSE) problems arising in the design of NoC-enabled manycore systems: placement of PEs and communication links to optimize two or more objectives (e.g., latency, energy, and throughput). Existing algorithms to solve MO-DSE problems suffer from scalability and accuracy challenges as size of the design space and the number of objectives grow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred as Multi-Objective Optimistic Search (MOOS) that performs adaptive design space exploration using a data-driven model to improve the speed and accuracy of multi-objective design optimization process. We apply MOOS to design both 3D heterogeneous and homogeneous manycore systems using Rodinia, PARSEC, and SPLASH2 benchmark suites. We demonstrate that MOOS improves the speed of finding solutions compared to state-of-the-art methods by up to 13X while uncovering designs that are up to 20% better in terms of NoC.

This success has led to their deployment in mobile and embedded systems for real-time applications. However, making repeated inferences using deep networks on embedded systems poses significant challenges due to constrained resources (e.g., energy and computing power). To address these challenges, we develop a principled co-design approach. Building on prior work, we develop a formalism referred to as Coarse-to-Fine Networks (C2F Nets) that allow us to employ classifiers of varying complexity to make predictions. We propose a principled optimization algorithm to automatically configure C2F Nets for a specified trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption for inference. The key idea is to select a classifier on-the-fly whose complexity is proportional to the hardness of the input example: simple classifiers for easy inputs and complex classifiers for hard inputs. We perform comprehensive experimental evaluation using four different C2F Net architectures on multiple real-world image classification tasks. Our results show that optimized C2F Net can reduce the Energy Delay Product (EDP) by 27 to 60 percent with no loss in accuracy when compared to the baseline solution, where all predictions are made using the most complex classifier in C2F Net.","tags":[],"title":"Trading-off accuracy and energy of deep inference on embedded systems: A co-design approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9a6e5010f07c53977367f9da0f2eb3cb","permalink":"https://nitthilan.github.io/project_details/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project_details/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sections Significant Areas-Current Task List - Tutorials - Applications - Prominent Papers\nMulti view based 3D models  Neural Fields Rendering System: Requirements:  Store objects as neural network  It could be a single neural network for each object multiple obejcts encoded in the same network using embedding as input.

The list of problems we are planning to attack: - Marching cubes would fail to recover the surface since the function learns only the boundary and does not learn inside the object. So a different learning algorithm is required for learning the 3D mesh object. We need to find a better algorithm to extract the 3D mesh and surface information. - A soluttion would be to shoot rays from different directions and choose only those points which have normals which are parallel to the ray of intersection. Use these points as an input to creat a point cloud and then convert this point cloud to a mesh using pointcloud2mesh algorithms, Surface Reconstruction - Alternative representation: Signed Distance field representation has better representation of objects than transparency representation.

Its been a while. It was one of those days. You have been thinking of saying something to your parents but did not have the confidence to talk about it. It was not different for a girl in here ninth grade.\nMy artificial deadline was before the van arrives for the school that day. I want to vent it all out on my parents.\n\u0026ldquo;Kanna, are you out of your bed. Its getting late for school.\u0026rdquo; Amma/Mom gave morning alert. Mickey was licking my feet. She curled down at my feet after her morning ritual of dropping the newspaper at my fathers bedside. \u0026ldquo;Han, Ma. I am up.\u0026rdquo; If not next she would be up in my room banging the door. This is her alarm. She is the final failsafe alarm when all alarms fail. Probably thats true about life too. Not sure. Parents.\nIt all started few months back as a joke. As usual, I did not finish my lunch. \u0026ldquo;Yaen di. Innaikuma. Everyday this has becoma habit. If this carries on, I will sell you and get a new kid\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Try it. You never know. I may get better parents. or worse you may get even fussy brother\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Why brother? You do not like a sister.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;There could never be a better girl than me\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Fine. Atleast have dinner now. We will decide your auction date after a while\u0026rdquo;\nI slowly walked to the bathroom, reluctantly. One, I hate my science teacher and her so called surprise tests scheduled today. Two, I was not sure how I am going to share my thoughts with my parents. My brush poking its way around my mouth as I ruminate on these thoughts. Standing under the shower, I felt the water was cold today. Probably it would rain and the school would get cancelled. \u0026ldquo;Anju, Can you hurry up a little? Its getting late for my office\u0026rdquo; Appa knocked on my door. I can hear Mickey too scratching the door. Stepping out I thought I should go through all I wanted to talk once again as I dressed up. Today it PT class. I have to wear white today. As I stepped out of my room, amma had already prepared the lunch. Appa was also ready to leave for office. I sat on the couch, my throne. Appa was at my feet dusting my socks and cleaning my shoes. Amma came with dosa on the plate ready to stuff it in my mouth before I run away to catch the van. there was a 5 minute gap. The right time. \u0026ldquo;Appa, is it necessary to bring in a yonger brother\u0026rdquo; Appa paused a little \u0026ldquo;Yaen ma, why this question suddenly?\u0026rdquo; Amma, dipped a piece of dosa in sambar and as it dripped on the plate \u0026ldquo;Solluma. What are your thoughts?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Illa ma. I am not feeling comfortable.\u0026rdquo; Appa dropped the shoes and took me on his lap and with a concerned face \u0026ldquo;Solluda. Why do you feel uncomfortable\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You said, two days back during dinner that you are planning to have sibling.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hmmm\u0026rdquo; Amma fed a socked dosa in my mounth. \u0026ldquo;Are you worried that you will have a competition.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Do not worry da. I will clean both your shoes.\u0026rdquo; With a muffled voice of dosa in mouth \u0026ldquo;Unhun. Thats not a issue. Is it necesary to bring a new sibling?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ennada sollura. I am not able to understand what you are saying?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Illa pa. Last year. On the way to Raju Sithappa place, it was raining heavily and we hit a dog by accident.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Sari. Amma, Thats were we found mickey. She came limping towards us.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Athan pa solluren. Last Sunday when we were sitting on the beach, there was a small kid selling Sundal. Why cannot he be my sibling?\u0026rdquo; Appa smiled. Amma fed the last piece of dosa and I rushed for the van. My phone vibrated, breaking my thought process. \u0026ldquo;Hey Anju, where are you?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Vaada. Just walk outside and walk towards the taxi stand.\u0026rdquo; If not for that day, I would not have met Koushik, my brother.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632809385,"objectID":"8e1450680f1a9bfc9484252fd6089183","permalink":"https://nitthilan.github.io/entertainment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/entertainment/","section":"","summary":"Sections Drawing - Movies - Short Stories (Tamil) - Investment - Cooking - Writing - Motivation - Food - Stories\nDrawing  Girl on mooon - youtube  Motivation  The motivation comes after work and not the other way around.","tags":null,"title":"Fun","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Intention of this page: w my intention is to document the ways to handle so that it would be helpful for others. I feel everyone would have had it in some form or other at some level or other. there are lot of myths and taboo which make people hesitant to share this. I too have not visited one yet..but just for the experience plan to do so sometime. It would be useful to know The more we understand the better it could be. Though my father warned to not go very deep in this pursuit since it may be counterproductive. I will anyway take it with a pinch of salt anyway\nHindrance to take help or How to handle it: taboo in general to see a psychologist we happy go to doctor for cold and fever. That is how much importance we give to mental health if people are exposed to scientific literature at least in the popular sense, the stigma maybe less. It\u0026rsquo;s more manageable. But I could handle it because I knew it was prevelant in my family. But it is still hard to discuss this in public. Like you say many hide this condition and until they come out and say it, you would not know. if you say you have visited a Psychologist they assume you have been to a mental asylum.\nTypes of depression: Clinic anxiety and depression are not tough to quantity. They base it on by how long you go into the bad state or how severe when you go through the bad patch Since my first experiences and experiences of other friends at that time, I think it is a continuum. It is not like normal people exist and those with mental health issues. It is an entire spectrum with varying colors, severity and meaning. Yup it\u0026rsquo;s a spectrum. Everyone has it in some level and it gets triggered based on environment and events\u0026hellip;\n Types of: Clinical depression, DSM  How does it manifest? How long does it last? What happens? Myths and Misconceptions? can you explain if this bad phase is lasts just a day or two?  How to identify that one has depression? What are the signs of depression? How to identify that one of your friends have depression? withdrawal from communication, withdrawal from light, withdrawl from daylight - harbinger symptoms How it is different from laziness and procrastination??  Further, it is not like Jaundice where it comes ones and you never get it. It\u0026rsquo;s more like seasonal cold. You get it in cycles and phases. when you are depressed you do things very weirdly like being very violent, you could hurt people etc.\nNope, at least for me you feel you do not want to do anything \u0026hellip;just lay idle and stare. You would not realize the passage of time. Usually it takes few days but some extreme cases it may go on for weeks or months.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the inability to do stuff which irritates you rather than doing things ðŸ˜‚\nVery true. The very fact that I knew something like this is possible helped me handle it better. Just that it is a passing phase and it\u0026rsquo;s not unique and permanent. Like cold it would just go away. You have to wait it out\nNitt, how does the depression start? Is it an event, or a prolonged disappointment about something, is it a feeling of failure/not meeting your own expectations, personal relationship issues? Can you throw some light? I am curious to know. This is an awesome question. Frankly, I have never spent time analysing how it started. Usually I get to know when I am into it say for few days or after it goes away where you mind feels cleared. It would be periods where you keep questioning all your actions. Your mind will go into endless arguments with yourself and eventually decide it\u0026rsquo;s better to do nothing than to take an action. You feel exhausted. But I have never been able to pinpoint and say when it starts. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” Let me think and if I find a reply will let you know.\nIt depends. It\u0026rsquo;s usually any problem at hand at that point. There were periods where I felt bad that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t gain courage to go and purchase a Pillaiyar statue from a shop during Pillaiyar chathurthi. You get a feeling that the shop keeper would cheat you. What happens if you do not get the right statue? Will everyone like it? What happens if I pay more for a normal one? What size should I get? If it is too big what should we do? If it is small will it not be useful? Then you start questioning why am I thinking so much even for a small thing like this. And then it would exhaust you and drain your mind so much you may go ahead and then make the most silliest mistakes possible and then it would haunt you again. It\u0026rsquo;s weird but it happens. On a normal day this would not even be in your thought. You go get something and forget the whole issue. I may have exaggerated this a bit but roughly this is what happens\nFriend 1: From my personal evening experience, I see that any one nagging issue can seep into everything by playing in our mind and creating anxiety in us Taking that nagging issue headlong usually solves it. But fear stops us .\nin general, i am less prone to frustration, depression etc since my nature has always been to not give too much importance to what others will think about me. also, i don\u0026rsquo;t delve much in the past , nor think too much about future. these help me in being able to attack present problems with assurance and certainty.\nwhat i am saying are for people for whom their biology is sound enough to be able to recognize these things properly. There can be medical conditions preventing us from thinking with clarity, making us more prone to anger, anxiety etc. Then it becomes difficult to just to self observations and bring things under control. and this issue has multiple layers and it maybe quite difficult to draw a line as to when to seek professional medical help\nHow to cope with Depression? Tips and Practices:  How to handle depression?  how to get out of depression? how to document depression? how to get things done during depression? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njESlZa2b10\u0026amp;list=PL4mtHuMZdZjyeGP7SCP6s75_Ic9CN3s3y\u0026amp;index=8\u0026amp;t=21s\u0026amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks second half of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drv3BP0Fdi8\u0026amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks   How to treat a friend who is in depression? How to prevent it from happening or is that really a possibility?  Do you do Pranayama on your non-depressed days? Not suggesting meditation by the way. It is contraindicated in most mental health situations. Some amount of regular, gentle asana/vinyasa practice followed by a regimen that elongates the breath and makes it rhythmic (4:8, 6:12 are readily achievable with daily practice for healthy bodies) and could help manage overall wellbeing.\nTalking to someone usually helps \u0026hellip; Even if it is a stone statue in God\n Thala, you need to write a journal. Just before sleeping, just write down bullet points of what you went through. Do this for two week. You can find some root reason.\nIf the bad mood starts because you have some work to be completed but its not getting completed. You have some pointers here.\ncheck if you go through clinical depression or anxiety.\nSo this bad patch of days - how long does it last until you bounce back?\nWhat makes you feel better after that? These are something, you can learn if you write journal.\nbut we also need to understand that human mind is very much capable to creating problems on its own. So, while medical help will be needed in a subset , there will be many for whom understanding their own mind helps a lot. A good psychiatrist has to tread both worlds and give guidance\nGenerally I have seen loneliness, boredom will automatically affect mental health easily.\nits considered very normal to keep thinking about past and future. we live in a mind-created world we don\u0026rsquo;t realise that at all. Issues getting magnified by mind.\n adults generally put in a lot of energy to maintain their self-image. lots of time, effort goes into it. And also lot of fear, anxiety about loss of self-image. and this is also considered normal by families/socities. the self-image we have is mind-created\nlets say we have a button to stop thinking for a day. what a relief it will be for us - no need to keep up any identity. no need to think about future problems. just eat when hungry and sleep if needed. a button to kill ourselves and live free\nyes - what is considered valuable by society/family largely decides our intentions/actions\nthis truth is staring at me for the last year or so.. the role mind plays.. i have become more observant i have had few minutes here and there of thoughtless observation and its changing my perspective of what i want to do in life' i have seen issues there in mind just disappear once i observe it..\nthe few minutes of thoughtlessness are generally filled with compassion/gratitude i can get a tiny peek at why great spiritual teachers have been obsessed with the mind and its behaviour\nWell, mind works with effort-reward. Life mostly doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like that. So if a jnani puts in all that effort (or perceives having done so) maybe their jnanam gets to be deficient. The reward in spiritual practice may not always look like what we expect.\nbut for me personally, its generally been a change in perspective which has happened. And i am happy for it. actually i don\u0026rsquo;t have much expectations to be honest, and i donno what to expect. the esoteric things that we hear about are as good as fairy tales\nGood demo of how depression looks like: Episode 3 of Modern Love.

My parents were very vocal about it and always encouraged me to not worry about it and have made me very comfortable. Amma is the more daring and cool of the two while appa would be precautious.

My parents somehow even now do not talk about stuff happening around them.Somehow they convey that to my wife, as she is keen to listen\n The world is inherently biased. Though the systems are available to make you believe that solutions are there to make it a balanced world. Democrazy does not make the world balanced since one side is inherently big.
