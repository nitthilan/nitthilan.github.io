[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am Nitthilan, pursuing PhD in AI/ML. Interested in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and Deep generative models (GAN, VQVAE) for Video/Image/3D Graphics (GCN/CNN).\n 12 years of software product development experience with wide exposure in building end to end systems from embedded to web technologies. Passionate about developing optimized algorithms and exploring different domains. Developed video applications for conferencing, broadcast, and storage. Worked on ME/RC for H264/MPEG and developed plugin/webRTC/Html5 based video endpoints  Current Focus Area: Working on Neural scene representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. Extending the ideas of Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF, Liu et. al. 2020) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF, Mildenhall et. al. 2020) to\n Multi-resolution coarse to fine approach of learning Single image to scene representation Animate 3D objects by adding a time dimension.  PhD Research: My research is at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Computing Systems (Sys). The overarching theme of my research is to bridge these two areas. Specifically, Iâ€™m working towards the vision of Edge AI to efficiently deploy AI solutions for emerging applications (e.g., robotics, selfdriving cars, augmented/virtual reality, and smart health) on edge platforms that are constrained by resources (power, compute, and memory).\n(a) Developed a novel hardware-aware design and optimization framework to trade-off power, performance, and accuracy for performing inference using deep neural networks.\n(b) Studied effective instantiations of this framework for different applications - Convolutional neural networks for image classification, Graph convolutional networks for 3D computer vision, and Generative adversarial networks for image manipulation tasks.\n(c) Published papers at top-tier venues including three journal papers (ACM/IEEE Transactions on CAD and Embedded Computing Systems) and four conference papers (AAAI, DAC, DATE, ICCAD). One journal paper is under review at Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://nitthilan.github.io/author/nitthilan-kannappan-jayakodi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/nitthilan-kannappan-jayakodi/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Nitthilan, pursuing PhD in AI/ML.
