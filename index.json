In this article, we propose a novel approach to trade off energy and accuracy of inference at runtime using a design space called Learning Energy Accuracy Tradeoff Networks (LEANets). The key idea behind LEANets is to design classifiers of increasing complexity using pretrained DNNs to perform input-specific adaptive inference. The accuracy and energy consumption of the adaptive inference scheme depends on a set of thresholds, one for each classifier. To determine the set of threshold vectors to achieve different energy and accuracy tradeoffs, we propose a novel multiobjective optimization approach. We can select the appropriate threshold vector at runtime based on the desired tradeoff. We perform experiments on multiple pretrained DNNs including ConvNet, VGG-16, and MobileNet using diverse image classification datasets.

However, due to their low-precision storage capability, these architectures cannot support all DNN layers and suffer from accuracy loss of the learned models. To address these challenges, we propose GRAMARCH, a heterogeneous architecture that combines the benefits of ReRAM and GPUs simultaneously by using a high-throughput 3D Network-on-Chip.

AD algorithms score the data instances and produce a ranked list of candidate anomalies, which are then analyzed by a human to discover the true anomalies. However, this process can be laborious for the human analyst when the number of false-positives is very high. Therefore, in many real-world AD applications including computer security and fraud prevention, the anomaly detector must be configurable by the human analyst to minimize the effort on false positives. In this paper, we study the problem of active learning to automatically tune ensemble of anomaly detectors to maximize the number of true anomalies discovered. We make four main contributions towards this goal. First, we present an important insight that explains the practical successes of AD ensembles and how ensembles are naturally suited for active learning. Second, we present several algorithms for active learning with tree-based AD ensembles. These algorithms help us to improve the diversity of discovered anomalies, generate rule sets for improved interpretability of anomalous instances, and adapt to streaming data settings in a principled manner. Third, we present a novel algorithm called GLocalized Anomaly Detection (GLAD) for active learning with generic AD ensembles. GLAD allows end-users to retain the use of simple and understandable global anomaly detectors by automatically learning their local relevance to specific data instances using label feedback. Fourth, we present extensive experiments to evaluate our insights and algorithms.

Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the integration of a large number of processing elements (PEs) in a single die. To design optimized manycore systems, we need to establish suitable trade-offs among multiple objectives including power, performance, and thermal. Therefore, we consider multi-objective design space exploration (MO-DSE) problems arising in the design of NoC-enabled manycore systems: placement of PEs and communication links to optimize two or more objectives (e.g., latency, energy, and throughput). Existing algorithms to solve MO-DSE problems suffer from scalability and accuracy challenges as size of the design space and the number of objectives grow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred as Multi-Objective Optimistic Search (MOOS) that performs adaptive design space exploration using a data-driven model to improve the speed and accuracy of multi-objective design optimization process. We apply MOOS to design both 3D heterogeneous and homogeneous manycore systems using Rodinia, PARSEC, and SPLASH2 benchmark suites. We demonstrate that MOOS improves the speed of finding solutions compared to state-of-the-art methods by up to 13X while uncovering designs that are up to 20% better in terms of NoC.

This success has led to their deployment in mobile and embedded systems for real-time applications. However, making repeated inferences using deep networks on embedded systems poses significant challenges due to constrained resources (e.g., energy and computing power). To address these challenges, we develop a principled co-design approach. Building on prior work, we develop a formalism referred to as Coarse-to-Fine Networks (C2F Nets) that allow us to employ classifiers of varying complexity to make predictions. We propose a principled optimization algorithm to automatically configure C2F Nets for a specified trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption for inference. The key idea is to select a classifier on-the-fly whose complexity is proportional to the hardness of the input example: simple classifiers for easy inputs and complex classifiers for hard inputs. We perform comprehensive experimental evaluation using four different C2F Net architectures on multiple real-world image classification tasks. Our results show that optimized C2F Net can reduce the Energy Delay Product (EDP) by 27 to 60 percent with no loss in accuracy when compared to the baseline solution, where all predictions are made using the most complex classifier in C2F Net.","tags":[],"title":"Trading-off accuracy and energy of deep inference on embedded systems: A co-design approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sections About - Significant Areas-Current Task List - Tutorials - Applications - Prominent Papers\nAbout Inspired from Pixar, Dreamworks, Sony and other animation studios.

The right time. \u0026ldquo;Appa, is it necessary to bring in a yonger brother\u0026rdquo; Appa paused a little \u0026ldquo;Yaen ma, why this question suddenly?\u0026rdquo; Amma, dipped a piece of dosa in sambar and as it dripped on the plate \u0026ldquo;Solluma. What are your thoughts?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Illa ma. I am not feeling comfortable.\u0026rdquo; Appa dropped the shoes and took me on his lap and with a concerned face \u0026ldquo;Solluda. Why do you feel uncomfortable\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You said, two days back during dinner that you are planning to have sibling.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hmmm\u0026rdquo; Amma fed a socked dosa in my mounth. \u0026ldquo;Are you worried that you will have a competition.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Do not worry da. I will clean both your shoes.\u0026rdquo; With a muffled voice of dosa in mouth \u0026ldquo;Unhun. Thats not a issue. Is it necesary to bring a new sibling?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ennada sollura. I am not able to understand what you are saying?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Illa pa. Last year. On the way to Raju Sithappa place, it was raining heavily and we hit a dog by accident.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Sari. Amma, Thats were we found mickey. She came limping towards us.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Athan pa solluren. Last Sunday when we were sitting on the beach, there was a small kid selling Sundal. Why cannot he be my sibling?\u0026rdquo; Appa smiled. Amma fed the last piece of dosa and I rushed for the van. My phone vibrated, breaking my thought process. \u0026ldquo;Hey Anju, where are you?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Vaada. Just walk outside and walk towards the taxi stand.\u0026rdquo; If not for that day, I would not have met Koushik, my brother.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e1450680f1a9bfc9484252fd6089183","permalink":"https://nitthilan.github.io/entertainment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/entertainment/","section":"","summary":"Sections Drawing - Movies - Short Stories (Tamil) - Investment - Cooking - Writing - Motivation - Food - Stories\nDrawing  Girl on mooon - youtube  Motivation  The motivation comes after work and not the other way around.","tags":null,"title":"Fun","type":"page"}]
